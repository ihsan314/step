      <h1>Ihsan Olawale's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>This is Ihsan Olawale's portfolio.</p>
      <p>I, Ihsan Olawale, am a STEP intern at Google. By the end of the internship I will have created a web project. This is practice.</p>
      <p>Click here to get a random message:</p>
      <button onclick="addRandomGreeting()">Hello</button>
      <div id="greeting-container"></div>
      <p>Here's what I look like, at least when looking at my Google profile:</p>
      <img src="/images/me.png" alt="What I look like" width="300" height="300">
      <p>After seeing what I look like, you might be interested to know more about me. Don't worry, I considered this during the design phase, and presented an opportunity to cycle through assorted facts.</p>
      <button onclick="addRandomFact()">Learn about me</button>
      <div id="fact-container"></div>
      <div id="quiz-container">
	<p>If you clicked the button I presented previously, you would have recognised you were trolled. I'm sorry for that, and have presented a set of multiple choice questions. Guess your way through to learn more about me:</p>
